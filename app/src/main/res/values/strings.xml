    <string name="MealDescription4">Have you ever heard of Utan Bisaya before?

    <string name="MealDescription5">Adobong Kangkong is a classic dish you can find in several Filipino homes.

    <string name="MealDescription6">Chop suey is a stir-fried vegetable dish that is cooked with meats such as chicken and pork. Shrimp and seafood can also be added. This chop suey recipe is special because it has almost every ingredient present. Chicken, pork, shrimp, and boiled quail eggs were all included in the recipe, along with fresh veggies.</string>
